# ALT-2-Proj
## Goal of Project:
  To relate the age of a car to its performance in RSA annual reviews. By plotting 
  the percent fail rate of cars against their age I planned to find a correlation
  between the two.
## Hypothesis:
  The age of a car will be directly proportional to its percent fail rate. A the average Toyota will be much more reliable as it ages than the average Ford
## Required packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
