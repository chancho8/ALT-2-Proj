# ALT-2-Proj: Unsurprising results of comparing reliability of vehicle makes
## Goal of Project:
  To relate the age of a car to its performance in RSA annual reviews. By plotting 
  the percent fail rate of cars against their age I planned to find a correlation
  between the two.
## Personal Interest:
  Many of us have been told that Toyota makes an extremely reliable car compared to other brands yet all other brands continue to make the same claim about their own products. With this project I plan to derive an answer to the question of which car is the most reliable. As an owner of a Toyota for ten years of consistent driving, I am interested to see if my thoughts on Toyota's reliability as a brand are true. I decided to compare the average Toyota vehicle's RSA annual fail rates with the average fail rates of Ford Vehicle's. I chose ford as it is a very similar brand with many competing vehicle models with Toyota.
## Hypothesis:
  The age of a car will be directly proportional to its percent fail rate. A the average Toyota will be much more reliable as it ages than the average Ford.
## Required packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
## First Iteration:
  In my first iteration of the project I created a scatterplot comparing the fail percentage and age of every car on the 2020 RSA annual review.
